# Customer Churn Prediction: A Comparative Machine Learning Study

This repository presents a comprehensive analysis and development of Machine Learning models to predict **Customer Churn**. The project explores a wide range of architectures—from classical boosting methods to modern tabular deep learning approaches—to identify the most effective strategy for identifying customers at risk of leaving a service.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The objective of this project is to build a robust predictive pipeline capable of handling tabular data and identifying patterns associated with customer attrition. We implemented and benchmarked multiple models of different natures to ensure the highest predictive performance.

### Key Results
After extensive testing and evaluation across several architectures, the **XGBoost** model achieved the best overall performance, demonstrating superior capability in capturing complex non-linear relationships within the dataset.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The project is organized into two main directories:

* **`/dataset`**: Contains the Google Colab notebooks focused on the data science lifecycle, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and feature engineering.
* **`/models`**: Contains individual notebooks for each model tested, including training, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation.
